# MY-TO-DO-LIST
This To-Do List app is a practical tool for anyone looking to organize their daily tasks in a simple, visually pleasing manner. It showcases fundamental web development skills and can be customized for further enhancements.

To-Do List Web Application

This project is a To-Do List Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this app is to provide users with an easy-to-use, interactive tool for managing their tasks and staying organized. With a clean and modern design, the app allows users to add, edit, remove, and mark tasks as completed.

Features:
Add Tasks: Users can input new tasks using the provided input field. Once a task is entered, it is added to the list for tracking.
Edit Tasks: Users can edit existing tasks by interacting with them, making it easier to update details or change the wording.
Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed, which applies a strikethrough effect and displays a checkmark, indicating the task is finished.
Remove Tasks: A "close" (X) button is available next to each task, enabling users to delete tasks from the list when they're no longer needed.
Clear All: The "Clear All" button removes all tasks from the list, allowing users to start fresh.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizesâ€”from mobile phones to desktop computers.
Smooth Interactions: The app includes smooth hover transitions, visually appealing backgrounds, and intuitive interactions for a more polished user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML: The app's basic structure and layout are built using HTML, ensuring proper placement of input fields, buttons, and list items.
CSS: The styling of the application is done using CSS, allowing for the creation of a clean and modern look. It also ensures the app is mobile-friendly.
JavaScript: JavaScript powers the interactivity, such as adding tasks to the list, editing or deleting tasks, and dynamically updating the task list based on user actions.
